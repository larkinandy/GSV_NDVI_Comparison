**Summary** <br>
The Python and C++ files in this folder were used to download Google Street View (GSV) images from the GSV API, download NDVI estimates from Google Earth Engine, and screen GSV images for green pixels and calculate greenpixel summary statistics.  Files are organized into folders, with one folder for each task described above. Note that several external modules, keys and tokens are needed.  Requirements vary by task and are described within each script.  

**Repository Folders**
- [**download GSV Images**](https://github.com/larkinandy/GSV_NDVI_Comparison/tree/master/download%20GSV%20images) - for downloading GSV images from the Google Street View API
- [**download NDVI**](https://github.com/larkinandy/GSV_NDVI_Comparison/tree/master/download%20NDVI) - downloading NDVI estimates at street view locations from the Google Earth Engine
- [**process GSV images**](https://github.com/larkinandy/GSV_NDVI_Comparison/tree/master/process%20GSV%20images) - derive estimates of greenspace from downloaded street view imagery
